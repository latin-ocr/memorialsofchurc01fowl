miracle is to be ascribed to the nrerits of Cuthberht or of AEthelwald, both,
it will be observed‚ Ripon worthies. The last mentioned is not to be con-
founded with sEthelwald, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who died in 760, and
whose bones were translated to Durham.

(l) This is the only notice we have of St. Columba's staff in connection
with Ripon, and we have no means of knowing whether it came to Ripon
in Wilfrithls lifetime or later.

(2) This proposal was made at agi-eat synod, probably held at Austerfield,
on the marche-s of Mercia and Nor-thumbria‚ under King Aldfrith, Berthwald‚
Archbishop of Canterbury, and almost all the bishops being present, wilfrith
being invited along with the rest, He rejected it with much indigna‘don,
and again appealed to Rome. Nosterfield, near Ripon, has generally been
supposed to have been the place of this synod. But Eddi's words are .
Estrcfdd, ()1test1·a‹3felcla, and Aetswz'nawath (or path). Two miles S.W. of
Auster-field, near Bawtry, is ‘Swinnow VVood ; ⁷ SE. is ‘ Swinecar Road!
A place on the northern confines of Mei-cia would be much more suit-
able for a general English synod than one in the heart of Northumbria.
Aldl'rith the WVise, king of Northumbria, who presided at this synod, is
not to be confounded with his elder half-brother Alehsrith, under-king of
Deir-a, and early patron of Wilsrith. See pp. 2-7.
