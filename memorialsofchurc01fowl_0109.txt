Ι. GRANTS TO THE CHURCH.

Ι. ΟΠΑΒΤΕΗ PURPORTING TO BE AETHELSTAN‘SJ

(Dvcnr or LANCASTER Rmonns, A. 23.)

In nomine Sanctae et Individuae Trinitatis, Atelstanus Rex
Angliae omnibus hominibus suis de Eboratura (sic)² per totam
Angliam, salutem. Sciatis quod ego confirmo ecclesiae et
capitulo Rypon’ pacem suam, et omnes libertates et consue-
tudines suas, et concedo eis curiam suam de omnibus querelis
et in omnibus curiis de hominibus Sancti Wilfridi, ipsis et
hominibus suis vel contra ipsos vel intra se ad invicem, vel

(1) This charter is printed by Dugdale‚ both in the ‘ Monasticon ' and in
his ‘History of the Collegiate Ohurch at Ripon7’ at the end of his ‘ St.
Paul's.' In the former work the Archbishop's initial is printed ‘ G‚’ which
led XValbran to suggest that it stood for Geoffrey, and that the document is
a fabrication of his time—Ripmz Guz'de, 12th ed. p. 30. It is here printed
from a Plea roll at the Public Record office. This document, printed above,
pp. 51-63, recites the present charter and the rimed chartei· as evidence in a
dispute about the rights of the Church. We here read ‘T. archiepiscopo‚’
as does Dugdale in his above-mentioned ⁶ History.’ In MS. DodsW. 160, fo.
250 v.‚ the T is very like G, whence, probably, the reading in the Monas-
ticon. AEthelstan reigned 924 or 925 to 940, Redewald and XVulstan Ι.
being contemporary Archbishops of York from 928. XValbran thinks that
this chartei· is of the nature of an inspeximus rather than of an original
grant, genuine 01· forged, and that the rimed char-ter, the language of which
is of the latter part of the thirteenth century, if not later, may be regarded
in a similar light. The ‘T' might stand for Thomas L, Thomas ΙΙ., or
Thurstan (1070-1140). On forged charters, see the preface to the Aberdeen
Register published by Spalding Club‚ p. xi, etc. and the preface to Green-
well‘s Γροᾱανίιινη, Surt. Soc. vol. 58. The references to Dugdale are, Old
Monasticon (1655), i. 1733 New Monasticon (1819), ii. 133; ‘Historical
Account of the Cathedrals of York,’ etc. (1715), p. 35.
