(1) Doom, judgment.

(2) Destruction, wreck. There seems to be something wanting here.
Dugdale prints :—

‘ Of freed mortel and in deeds
Yat yair don is; Tol, Tem,
Soc, Sao, with yren and with water deme
And yat the land, etc.'

The reference to ordeal by hot iron and by water takes us back to times
long before the date of this chartei· in its present form. The English ordea]
went out of use soon after the Norman Conquest. But it seems not unlikely
that the iron, or one of the irons used at Ripon, was preserved as ‘Su
Wilffid's buming-i1·on,' which will be noticed in connection with its
occurrence in the Account-rolls as a source of income up to the Reformation.

(3) ‘ That!

(4) Each kind of taX.

(5) ‘ At ' is here the sign of the infinitive. See ‘ Layfolks' Mass-book,’
E.E.T.S. 295. The meaning of this obscure couplet seems to be, ‘That I
have none that belong to me, (who) in there (sc. in the Liberty) war-ship
(military service) shall have to do.'

(6) This document, like the last, is printed from the Duchy of Lau-
easter Plea roll. Dugdale prints it ‘ex Registro Con. Eccles. de Ripon
penes . . . Lindale Subdeeanum 1630' (reff. as above, p. 89, n.). Canon
Simmons considers it to have been versified in Northumbrian English and
copied by a scribe who has introduced Midland forms.
