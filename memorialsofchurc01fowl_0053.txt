(1) Bromton goes on 10 say he has also the bishopric of Durham, which
was in the island of Lindisfarne, and that of Candida Casa, or Galloway
(Whithorn), and that in the same kingdom the diocese of Carlisle was
afterwards formed. The passage occurs in a notice of the seven kingdom-s
(more or less) which were united under Ecgberht about Aa). 828.

(3) The precise date is not known. The similar grant to Beverley is
dated ΑΔ). 925 111 Dugdale, ii. 129. The English rimed charters, however,
which profess to have been given by AEthelstan, are compositione of the latter
part of the thirteenth century. They may never have been intended to
deceive any 0110, but only to be more easily committed to memory 111811 the
original charters. The Latin charter of the same king, to the same effect as
his rimed charter, printed in Dugdale, ii. 133, is also considered by &Valbran
to be a fabrication of later date. Both will be found below.

(4) This cross stood on the road between Ripon and Nunwick, by a field
still called Athelstane Olose. The stump of ‘ Archangel ’ 01· ‘ Kangel ' cross
was lately sunk in the hedge of a lane leading from the canal bridge to
Bondgate, and the base and stump of Sharow cross still remain on the
Sharow Road. Another cross stood at Bishopton. At the end of the
thirteenth century there were eight of these mile-crosseS, 11181 luncr the‘ Leuga
