PREFACE.

-ψ-

THE present volume is a first instalment of what is intended as
a pretty complete collection of original materials for the history
of the Church of Ripon and its dependent foundations up to
the middle of the sixteenth century, so far as they can be
obtained. The ‘Excerpts' are, as will be seen, mostly from
printed sources, but as there is so little to be found about
Ripon in the works of our historians and chroniclers‚ it has
seemed worth while to bring that little together. Among
these will be found some important extracts from printed and
unprinted rolls at the Public Record Office, mostly relating to
the privileges of the Archbishops of York in Ripon and in other
places. It is impossible to know when such a collection is
complete, and absolute completeness is not claimed for this
one. But it is hoped that those who are interested in the
history of Ripon will here find an acceptable catena of authori-
ties, and the editor will be glad to hear if there be any impor-
tant omissions. Those omitted passages which have been
discovered already, are given in the Appendix‚ and others
might be supplied in an appendix to Volume 11.

The collection of MSS. in the possession of the Chapter is
lamentably small. The Act Book of 1452—1506 has been
printed in the present series, vol. lxiv. The original charters
are only the leavings of some one in the last century, who
copied the best he could find into a book now in the possession
of T. S. Darnbrough, Esq.‚ referred to in this volume as
‘DARNBROUGH MS? The charters selected for this purpose
