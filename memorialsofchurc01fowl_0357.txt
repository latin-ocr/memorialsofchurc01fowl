P. 2, note 1 (and elsewhere), for wilfrid, the ordinary form, read Wilfrith,
adopted in this volume as nearer to the original form.

P. 4, line 10, read et vitam.

P. 6, line 22. For a notice of the ⁴ Ripon Psalter,’ see Acts of Chapter, vol.
64 of this series, p. 382.

P. 9, side-note, read endowments claimed.

P. 10, line 14 and note 4. ‘Bibliotheca’ here probably means a case to
contain the Gospels, and not, as commonly, a Bible. See Ducange
(last ed.). Some of the early Irish books of the Gospels have cases of

great magnificence, while for simple protection, especially while on
journeys, they had satchels (saeculi) or leather cases, which varied in

size and execution. The ancient Irish Life of St. Columba distinguishes
two kinds. ‘ For it was his custom to make crosses and cases [polaire],
and satchels [tiaga] for books and all ehurch furniture! See Life of
St. Columba in ‘ Historians of Scotland,' lib. ii. cap. viii„ and Dr.
Reeves’s note, p. 269 ; also below, on lines 15-18.

Ρ. 12. See AppendiX, pp. 320, 321.

Psalter, several of the antiphons in which are couplets out of Fride-
goda.

P. 12, line 22. Semicolon at the end.

P. 13, line 1. We should perhaps read ‘Pieria neve tulit, neu dissologia
rupit.’ Nor did bitterness annul it (sc. his vow), nor dissimulatiOn
break it, then begin a new sentence.

P. 13, line 12. ‘ In cancellis‚' within the rails or screen 3 see Ducange.

P. 13, lines 15-18. The sense of these lines is obscure,but we should doubt-
less read ‘capsacibus,' and understand it of satchels for books. F ride-
goda uses the same word for reliqum-ies in line 915, where the queen is
rebuked for dragging them from the neck of wilfrith :—

‘ Capsaces collo dempsisti immunda verendo.’

P. 18, note 2, and 19, note 3, read Berchtwald.
