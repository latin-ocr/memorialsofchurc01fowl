viii PREFACE.

seem never to have been returned, for they cannot be found.
They are now printed from the Darnbrough MS„ together
with the original charters still extant, all of which have more
or less of at least local interest. The few Ripon charters
printed by Dugdale have also disappeared, but are here
reprinted by way of making the collection as complete as
possible. A small bullarium will be found after the grants to
the church, pp. llo-119. The rest of the charters then
follow, together with other original documents, classified
according to subjects. The existing materials relating to the
hospitals are chiefly to be found in the rolls at the Public
Record Office, where they have been entered in connection
with lawsuits and royal visitations. One of the most important
of these was unfortunately overlooked until it was too late to
print it in its proper place3 it will be found in the Appen-
dix, p. 322. As to the Sanctuary Records, see p. 310, note 1.
In a future volume, or volumes, of these ‘ Memorials,’ we
hope to give a large collection of extract-s relating to Ripon
from the Archbishops' Registers at York3 the best part of the
few account-rolls that have not been lost 3 a series of Ripon
Wills from the York Registry3 the Chantry Certificates and
Duchy of Lancaster Ministers' Aoeounts, from the Public Record
Office, and other unpublished matter, together with Fasti
Riponc'enses, originally compiled by the late Rev. John XVard,
Rector of Wath, near Ripon. These will be corrected and
completed so far as additional information has been obtained.
The editor has now to express his thanks to the Dean and
Chapter of Ripon for the liberal way in which they have so
long trusted him with their MSS.; to the Rev. J. W. Darn-
brough, for the loan of his brother-’s and other MSS„ and for
help at various times3 to the officials at the Public Record
Office, and at the York Registry, for their courteous attention
during work extending over several weeks; to Mrs. ward, of
wath, for the use of her late husband’s collections ; to Canon
Raine, aud to the Rev. Edward S. Xl'ilson, vicar of WVintcrton,
