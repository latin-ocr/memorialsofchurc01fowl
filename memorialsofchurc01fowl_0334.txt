(1) There are no records of the sanctuary of Ripon in existence, so far as
we know. Mr. 1Valbran, however, mentions a case of a culprit who ‘fied
10 1110 111011 insufficient sanctum-y at Ripon' in 1539 (szuon Getide, 12th ed.
p. 31). ‘To ‘sak' Darnton ‘trod ' was a common Ripon saying for anyonc
who had abscondvd. Dr. Raine ’thought it alluded to 1110 sanctuary runners
who flod from Ilipon to Diu-ham by way of Darlington. The following ex-
trac-ts 1011110. to men of Ripon who fied to Durham 01· ‘to Beverley. Most of
1110111 were printed in the fifth volume of the present series. They are here
0011001011 and completed from the original MSS. The Durham entries occur
in 1110 registvrs of the convent among those relating to other matters. Those
of 1ὶονε>1101ν are in a Sanctuary Register which was kept separately, now
MS. Harl. 4202, extending from about 1478 to 1539.

(9) Not in 1110 volume ‘ Sanct. Dunelm. et Beverlac?

(53) The Dux-ham Cathedral bells were recast in 1693. But the tenor bell
bears the inscription, ‘Camp. &Outhborti olim (1111111011, Dec. et Gap. Dunelm.
