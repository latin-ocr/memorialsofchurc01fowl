Venerandae dignitatis Lullo ¹ episc. Botwinus ² abb. optabilem
in Christo salutem.

Litterae auctoritatis tuae, quas cum Divinae pietatis studio
usque ad nos direxisti, laetificaverunt me valde, quia tu imbre
coelestis roris illectus ultimum me servunculum servorum Dei
cum tam magna fide Divini amoris, saeculariaeque dignitatis
munere visitare dignatus fuisti. Gratias ago Deo, petens cum
intimae charitatis desiderio, ut fidus fautor mihi per celsitudinem
sanctitatis tuae coram Christo Jesu existas, in istoque seculo
serena. mente amicus, si rector rerum omnium istius vitae in
itinere me longius super te sudare dijudicat, ploro, indesinenter
precans cum omni caterva quae Christo Domino sub mea con-
ditione deservit, Divinae misericordiae solatia animae tuae largiri,
ut tu simili modo ecclesiarum tuarum subsidia mihi praestare
digneris. Haec quoque modica munuscula, id est iii lacernas ³
almitati tuae mitto, optans ut accepta sint.

(1) St. Lullus or Lullon, Archbishop of Mayence or Mentz, was an
Englishman, who after having studied at Jarrow under the Ven. Baeda,
went into Germanv, where he was joyfully received by his cousin, St.
Boniface‚ who ordained him, found him occupation as a missionary monk,
and ultimately nominated him as his successor. He ruled the diocese os
Mentz from 781 to 785, and was much consulted on matters of doctrine
and discipline. Some of his own letters and of those addressed to him are
published among those of St. Boniface.

(2) Botwine, Abbat of Ripon, died in 785 or 786 (see below). There
was a Botwine, Abbat of Peterborough, in 765 and 789, and it is not
certainly known by which of the two this letter was written.

(3) The lacerna of the Romans was an open cloak fastened on the right
shoulder by a fibula. Itv sometimes had a camellus or hood attached to it.
It perhaps bears the same relation to the cope as does the pomula or closed
eloak to the chasuble, and these which were sent to St. Lullus were probably
ecclesiastical vestments enriched with ‘the far-famed English embroidery.

(4) See above, note 2. The Peterborough and worcester chronieles place
his death in 7 85. ‘ Her forssferde Botwine, abbot in Hripum.' The Meli-ose
