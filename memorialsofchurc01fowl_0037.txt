AETHELWALD OF RIPON, IIERMIT IN F ARNE.
BAEDA, V. i.

Successit autem viro Domini Cudbercto, in exercenda vita
solitaria quam in insula Farne ante episcopatus sui tempora
gerebat, vir venerabilis Oidiluald‚³ qui multis annis in monas-

terio quod dicitur Inhrypum acceptum presbyteratus officium
condignis gradu ipse consecrabat actibus. Cujus ut meritum
vel vita qualis fuerit, certius clarescat, unum ejus narro mira-
culum quod mihi unus e fratribus propter quos et in quibus
patratum est, ipse narravit: videlicet Gudfrid‚ venerabilis
Christi famulus et presbyter, qui etiam postea fratribus ejusdem

ecclesiae Lindisfarnensis in qua educatus est, abbatis jure prze-
fuiti. . . ,⁴

Mansit autem idem vir Dei in insula Farne duodecim annis
ibidemque defunctus: sed in insula Lindisfarnensi juxta prae-
fatorum corpora episcoporum, in ecclesia beati apostoli Petri
sepultus est. Gesta vero sunt haec temporibus Alfridi regis,

qui post fratrem suum Ecgfridum genti Nordanhymbrorum
decem et, novem annis praefuit.⁵

Aldfrith led to Wilfn'th's expulsion from Northumbria. He lived in
Mercia for some yearS, and sueceeded Saxulf as Bishop of Leicester in 691.

(3) The Northumbrian form of the lVest Saxon Ethelwald (xEffielwold,
Aethelwaldus‚ AEdiluualdus).

(4) Gudfrid came to Farne island, with two other brethren, to visit
AEthelwald. They were nearly prevented landing by a violent sto1·m,which
ceased at the prayers of ⁴Ethelwald, and returned when they had lauded.

(5) In the last chapter of bis Life of St. eathberht, Baeda relates how
AEthelwald repaired the oratory in Fame, which had become ruinous. He
stopped up the chinks, and nailed up a calf's hide in the corner where he
and his predecessor Cuthberht were wont to stand or kneel in prayer. In
the time of Felgeffl, the next occupant, the oratory was rebuilt, and the
calf's hide cut in pieces and distributed to petitioners for relies. Felgeld,
however. first tried its effect on himself, and believed himself to be cured of
some disease in his sace by washing it with water in which a portion of the
hide had been immersed. ssaeda says that God only knows whether the
