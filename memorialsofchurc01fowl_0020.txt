Church of Ripon by way of introduction to a future volume of
these Memorials.

It has been thought well to use Mr. Le Keux's plate of
Ripon seals, which has already served for the Chapter Acts, as
the frontispiece to the present volume, for which it is no less
suitable. The seal of Nicholas Murdac, canon of Ripon, cir.
A.D. 1200, is used as a counter-seal to the old Chapter seal
bearing the Holy Lamb on an‘ altar. The manner in which the
altar is draped is very singular, and it is no less remarkable
that the canon appears to be vested in a plain albe over a
cassock, without any almuce or other indication of his rank.

The autotype which faces page 90 is a perfect reproduction,
by Mr. C. Praetorius, of the earliest known copy of AEthelstan's
rimed charter, while the one facing page 128, executed by the
same skilful hand, represents three interesting seals as well as
they could be done by the autotype process, The two which
hang by labels are described page 129 3 the central one is from
a cast in the possession of Canon Raine‚ from the collec-
tion of the late Mr. Walbran. St. Mary Magdalene is repre-
sented with her long hair, holding the alabaster flask of
ointment in 1161 right hand, and apparently a book in her left.
The inscription 13, ÷ S. HOSPITALIS SCE MARIE MAG-
DALEN E, RIPOVN. No seals of the other Hospitals have
come in our way. -

For the woodcut of Sharow Cross on page 318, from a
sketch by Mr. Walbran, we are indebted to ΜΓ. W. Harrison,
of Ripon.

A rather long list of additions and corrections will be found
at page 333. Most of the latter relate to very trifling matters,
but all the 611013 which have been noticed‚ however slight, are
corrected.
