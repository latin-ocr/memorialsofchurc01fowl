WILFRITII IN FRIESLAND.
Enmus, xxvi.

Deinde eo anno,2 accepta praedicatione, omnes principes,
exceptis pauciS‚ et multa millia vulgi in nomine Domini bap-
tizabat3 et primum ibi, secundum Apostolum, fundamentum
fidei posuit, quod adhuc superaedificat filius ejus³ in Hripis
nutritus, gratia Dei wilbrordus episcopus, multo labore desu-
dans, cujus merces manet in aeternum.⁴

(1) Eadhaed appears to have resigned the see of Ripon when wilfrith
was reinstated as bishop of the whole northern province in 686.

(2) This was when wilfrith spent the winter in Friesland as he was
going to Rome to appeal against the division of his diocese.

(3) Note again how a pupil of wilfrith is described as his ‘ son,' a mode
of speaking familiar to us in biblical language.

(4) The years Aa). 679-680, although not affording any matters of
Ripon history, are memorable in connection with Wilfrith. In October,
Aa). 679, a council was held at Rome under Pope Agatho, consisting of
seventeen bishops and thirty-five priests, in the cause of the Church of
England. This was held irrespectire of Wilfrid, though he was in Rome at
the time. In the same year there was a council at Rome of fifty bishops
and presbyters, under the same pope, to receive and decide on Wilfrid‘s
personal appeal. This council decreed that he should be restored to his
Northumbrian see in these terme, ‘Statuimus atque decernimus ut· Deo
amabilis wilfridus Episcopus Episcopatum quem nuper habuit recipiat,
salva diffinitione superius ordinata (Le. that he should be subject to Rome) :
et quos cum consensu concilii ibidem congregandi elegerit sibi adjutores
Episcopos, cum quibus debeat pacifice conversari secundum regulam superius
constitutam, a sanctissimo Archiepiscopo promoti ordinentur Episcopi, ex-
pulsis proculdubio eis qui in ejus absentia in Episcopatum innormiter missi
sunt..'—Eddiu.3, xxxii. On March 27, A.1). 680, Pope Agatho held a council
of one hundred and twenty-five bishops, in preparation for the OEcumenical
Gouncil of Constantinople, against the Monothelites. wilfrith signed as
Bishop of York, on behalf of the British. English, Irish, Scots, and Picts.
On September 17, AJ). 680, was held the Council of Hattield, in Hertsord-
shire, which declared the orthodoxy of the Ohurch of England. Wilsrit-ffs
name is attached to a spurious papal privilege to Peterborough monastery,
said to have been presented by him to this council. He may have left
Rome aster Easter‚ ΑΛ). 680, and might have reached England before Sep-
tember. But Eddi says he proceeded at once to Northumbria, and it is not
likely that he would be at the Council of Hatfield and Eddi not mention it.
